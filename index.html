        <h1> About</h1>
        <p>Cricket is a game of strategy between two teams. Each team bats and fields in turn â€“ the batters try to score runs; the fielders try to stop them. ... A run is scored when the striking batsman (the batsman that the bowler is bowling to) runs from one crease line to the other, after hitting the ball.</p>

        <h1>My favourite Hobby-Cricket</h1>
        <p> My hobby is playing cricket. Before the pandemic, I used to go down to play cricket everyday. I used to play for minimum for 2 hours.But because of the pandemic, I have not play cricket since March 2020. Cricket was founded by South-East England in the 16th Century. It became the country's national sport in the 18th century and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International cricket started in 1844 and Test cricket started in 1874.</p>
